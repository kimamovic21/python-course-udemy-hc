## Chapter 1: integers and object identity

`sugar_amount` first refers to the integer `2`, then is reassigned to `12`.

- An integer (`int`) represents a whole number.
- Integers are **immutable**: their value cannot be changed in place. Reassigning the variable makes it refer to another object.
- `id()` returns a number identifying an object during its lifetime. The calls to `id(2)` and `id(12)` inspect the identities of those two integer objects.

The sugar values printed are `2` and `12`. Object IDs can differ between program runs, so the exact ID numbers are not expected output to memorise.

## Chapter 2: mutable sets

`spice_mix = set()` creates an empty **set**. The program adds `"Ginger"`, `"cardamom"`, and `"lemon"` with `.add()`.

- A set stores unique values. Adding the same value again does not create a duplicate.
- A set does not guarantee the order in which its contents are displayed.
- Sets are **mutable**: `.add()` changes the existing object, so its ID stays the same before and after these additions.

In the output, the lines containing `id(spice_mix)` show the object's identity; the lines containing `spice_mix` show its contents.

## Chapter 3: arithmetic and large numbers

The examples practise calculations with tea, milk, and cardamom:

| Operator | Meaning | Example from the lesson | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `+` | Addition | `14 + 3` | `17` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `14 - 3` | `11` |
| `/` | Division | `7 / 4` | `1.75` |
| `//` | Floor division | `7 // 4` | `1` |
| `%` | Remainder | `10 % 3` | `1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3` | `8` |

Each calculation uses the variables in its expression. Calculating `total_grams` does not change `black_tea_grams`, which still contains `14` when the subtraction runs.

For these integer inputs, `/` returns a `float`, while `//` returns an `int` by rounding the quotient down. The `%` operator gives the remainder. `2 ** 3` means `2 * 2 * 2`.

The literal `1_000_000_000` is one billion. Underscores make the number easier to read without changing its value; the program prints it as `1000000000`.

## Chapter 4: booleans and conditions

A **boolean** (`bool`) has one of two values: `True` or `False`.

- In arithmetic, `True` acts as `1` and `False` as `0`. Therefore, `5 + True` produces `6`.
- `bool(0)` produces `False`, which represents the absence of milk in this example.
- With the two boolean values used here, `water_hot and tea_added` is `True` when both are `True`.

Expected output:

```text
Total actions: 6
Is there milk? False
Can we serve chai? True
```

## Chapter 5: floats and precision

`ideal_temp = 95.5` and `current_temp = 95.49` are **floating-point numbers** (`float`). The program prints both temperatures, subtracts them, and displays `sys.float_info`.

Many decimal values are stored approximately as binary floating-point numbers. As a result, the subtraction can display a value very close to `0.01` with extra decimal digits. This is normal floating-point behaviour.

`sys.float_info` describes the precision and range of Python's floating-point numbers. There is no need to memorise all of its fields at this stage.

`Fraction` and `Decimal` are also imported in the current file, but are not used in its calculations yet.

## Chapter 6: strings, slicing, and UTF-8

A **string** (`str`) stores text. `chai_type`, `customer_name`, `chai_description`, and `label_text` all contain strings in this example.

An **f-string** starts with `f` before the quotation marks. Expressions inside `{}` are replaced with their values, allowing the order message to include the customer's name and type of chai.

String slicing extracts part of a string or changes the direction in which it is read. For `chai_description = "Aromatic and Bold"`:

| Expression | Result | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chai_description[:8]` | `"Aromatic"` | Characters from the start up to, but not including, index `8`. |
| `chai_description[12:]` | `" Bold"` | Characters from index `12` to the end, including the space before `Bold`. |
| `chai_description[::-1]` | `"dloB dna citamorA"` | The entire description in reverse order. |

String indexes start at `0`. The reverse slice produces the whole reversed description, even though the current program labels that output as `Last word`.

The final part of the lesson converts `"Chai Spécial"` between text and bytes:

- `.encode("utf-8")` converts the string into a `bytes` object stored in `encoded_label`.
- The encoded value is displayed as `b'Chai Sp\xc3\xa9cial'`. The `b` prefix identifies bytes; the accented `é` is represented by two bytes in UTF-8.
- `.decode("utf-8")` converts those bytes back into the original string, stored in `decoded_label`.

Encoding and decoding with the same encoding restores the text, including its accented character.

## Chapter 7: tuples, unpacking, and swapping

`masala_spices = ("cardamom", "cloves", "cinnamon")` creates a **tuple**, an ordered collection whose items cannot be replaced, added, or removed in place.

The lesson demonstrates three operations:

- **Unpacking:** `spice1, spice2, spice3 = masala_spices` assigns each tuple item to a separate variable in order.
- **Swapping:** `ginger_ratio, cardamom_ratio = cardamom_ratio, ginger_ratio` exchanges the values `2` and `1`. Python evaluates the right-hand side before assigning the values on the left.
- **Membership testing:** `"cinnamon" in masala_spices` returns `True` because the tuple contains that value.

Swapping changes which values the variables refer to; it does not modify the original `masala_spices` tuple.

## Chapter 8: lists and byte arrays

A **list** is an ordered, mutable collection. This lesson starts with ingredients such as `"water"`, `"milk"`, and `"black tea"`, then changes the lists with these methods:

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `.append(value)` | Adds one item at the end. |
| `.remove(value)` | Removes the first matching item. |
| `.extend(other_list)` | Adds the items from another list at the end. |
| `.insert(index, value)` | Adds an item at a position; indexes start at `0`. |
| `.pop()` | Removes and returns the last item. |
| `.reverse()` | Reverses the current order in place. |
| `.sort()` | Sorts the list in place; the strings in this lesson are sorted alphabetically. |

For `sugar_levels = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `max(sugar_levels)` returns `5` and `min(sugar_levels)` returns `1`.

The `+` operator creates a new list by joining two lists. The `*` operator creates a new list by repeating the items: `["black tea", "water"] * 3` contains six items. These expressions leave the original lists unchanged.

The final example creates a **bytearray**, a mutable sequence of bytes. Each byte has a value from `0` to `255`:

```python
raw_spice_data = bytearray(b"CINNAMON")
raw_spice_data = raw_spice_data.replace(b"CINNA", b"CARD")
```

The `b` prefix marks a bytes literal. Replacing `CINNA` with `CARD` leaves the ending `MON`, producing `CARDMON`. The `.replace()` method returns a new `bytearray`, which is assigned back to `raw_spice_data`.

The final line prints:

```text
Bytes: bytearray(b'CARDMON')
```

## Chapter 9: comparing sets

The lesson creates two sets: `essential_spices` contains cardamom, ginger, and cinnamon; `optional_spices` contains cloves, ginger, and black pepper.

| Operator | Operation | Result in this lesson |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\|` | Union: all unique values from both sets. | Cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper. |
| `&` | Intersection: values present in both sets. | Ginger. |
| `-` | Difference: values in the first set but not the second. | Cardamom and cinnamon. |
| `in` | Membership: check whether a value is present. | `"cloves" in optional_spices` returns `True`. |

The union, intersection, and difference expressions create new sets, leaving the original sets unchanged. Difference is directional: `essential_spices - optional_spices` asks specifically which essential spices are missing from the optional set.

Sets do not guarantee a display order. Focus on which values are included when reading the printed results.

## Coding exercise 01: Playing with Numbers

**Completed: all Udemy tests passed.**

Read the [challenge description](CODING_EXERCISE_01.md) and the [Python solution](coding_exercise_01.py).

The program uses `first_number = 10` and `second_number = 5`. It prints the results of addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), floor division (`//`), and modulus (`%`), in that order.

Expected output:

```text
15
5
50
2.0
2
0
```

The exercise prints **only the results**, one per line. Labels such as `Addition:` or `Division:` made the Udemy tests fail because the tests expected an exact output match.

Notice that `/` produces `2.0`, a `float`, even though the division has no remainder. With these integer inputs, `//` produces `2`, an `int`.

## Coding exercise 02: Should You Go for a Walk?

Read the [challenge description](CODING_EXERCISE_02.md) and the [Python solution](coding_exercise_02.py).

The starting conditions are `is_sunny = True` and `have_umbrella = False`. The exercise combines these boolean values with three logical operators:

- `not` reverses a boolean value: `True` becomes `False`, and `False` becomes `True`.
- `and` returns `True` when both boolean conditions are `True`.
- `or` returns `True` when at least one boolean condition is `True`.

| Expression | Evaluation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `not is_sunny` | `not True` | `False` |
| `not have_umbrella` | `not False` | `True` |
| `is_sunny and not have_umbrella` | `True and True` | `True` |
| `is_sunny or have_umbrella` | `True or False` | `True` |

Expected output, in the order requested by the challenge:

```text
False
True
True
True
```

The solution prints only these four boolean values, one per line, without extra labels.

## Coding exercise 03: Swapping Temperature

Read the [challenge description](CODING_EXERCISE_03.md) and the [Python solution](coding_exercise_03.py).

The initial values are `min_temp = 40` and `max_temp = 25`. Tuple packing and unpacking swap them without an extra variable:

```python
min_temp, max_temp = max_temp, min_temp
```

The old values on the right form `(25, 40)`, then are assigned to the variables on the left. The program prints the corrected minimum first, followed by the maximum:

```text
25
40
```

## Coding exercise 04: Shopping List

Read the [challenge description](CODING_EXERCISE_04.md) and the [Python solution](coding_exercise_04.py).

The program starts with `my_cart = ["apples", "bananas", "milk"]` and applies the requested list operations in order. It prints the list after each requested change.

- `.append()` adds bread, `.insert()` adds ketchup at the beginning, and `.remove()` removes bananas.
- `.pop()` removes bread, the last item at that point, and stores it in `removed_item`. The program prints that item separately.
- `.extend()` adds rice and butter; `.sort()` orders the list alphabetically, and `.reverse()` reverses that order.
- `combined_cart = my_cart + ["juice", "jam"]` creates a new combined list without changing `my_cart`.
- `duplicated_cart = my_cart * 2` repeats the current five-item cart twice. Juice and jam appear only in `combined_cart`.
- `.split()` converts `"tomato cucumber spinach"` into a list of three words by splitting at whitespace.

Expected output, without extra labels:

```text
['apples', 'bananas', 'milk']
['apples', 'bananas', 'milk', 'bread']
['ketchup', 'apples', 'bananas', 'milk', 'bread']
['ketchup', 'apples', 'milk', 'bread']
bread
['ketchup', 'apples', 'milk', 'rice', 'butter']
['apples', 'butter', 'ketchup', 'milk', 'rice']
['rice', 'milk', 'ketchup', 'butter', 'apples']
['rice', 'milk', 'ketchup', 'butter', 'apples', 'juice', 'jam']
['rice', 'milk', 'ketchup', 'butter', 'apples', 'rice', 'milk', 'ketchup', 'butter', 'apples']
['tomato', 'cucumber', 'spinach']
```

## Coding exercise 05: Managing Store Inventory

Read the [challenge description](CODING_EXERCISE_05.md) and the [Python solution](coding_exercise_05.py).

The program compares the products available in two branches:

- Branch A: bread, milk, butter, and jam.
- Branch B: bread, cheese, butter, and ketchup.

The union contains all six unique products. The intersection contains bread and butter. The difference `branch_a_products - branch_b_products` contains milk and jam. Checking for ketchup in branch A returns `False`.

`essential_items = frozenset({"milk", "bread", "ketchup"})` creates an **immutable set**. Its elements cannot be added or removed after creation. Membership checks and set comparisons are still supported.

The solution uses **f-strings** to label each result, making it clear which branch or operation is being displayed.

Example output; the order of elements inside each set or frozenset may vary:

```text
Branch A products: {'bread', 'milk', 'butter', 'jam'}
Branch B products: {'bread', 'cheese', 'butter', 'ketchup'}
Union of both branches: {'bread', 'milk', 'butter', 'jam', 'cheese', 'ketchup'}
Intersection of both branches: {'bread', 'butter'}
Products only in branch A: {'milk', 'jam'}
Is ketchup available in branch A? False
Essential items (frozenset): frozenset({'milk', 'bread', 'ketchup'})
```
